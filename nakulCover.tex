\cvparagraph{About Me}
I am currently a full-time student at Arizona State University (ASU) at Tempe, Arizona. I am scheduled to graduate in May 2018 with a degree in Master’s in Computer Science. Previously, I was working with Target India Corporation at Bangalore as a Developer in Business Intelligence and Analytics. I have a 2-year experience in developing web applications at Target. I was responsible for developing full stack web applications.
My responsibility as a web developer ranged from designing/warehousing the database that would support the application, developing REST APIs and building responsive User-interfaces. The application I worked for the longest period in my experience involved cleansing and normalizing data using complex SQL queries, warehousing and designing the database in SQL Server, the services and APIs in .Net/C#, functionality in angularJs and the front end design in HTML5, CSS3, twitter-bootstrap. I have spent a large part of my time designing web pages for the clients, making them very responsive to all platforms and screen sizes. 

Additionally,  I also have 1 year of experience in big data analytics where I developed scripts in python to analyze Guest Shopping Patterns at Target. The project was to map each guest that shops at Target into a polygonal block whose latitude and longitude details are provided by the US Government. 
Once, the area of each guest is allocated, research was done to analyze the shopping patterns for marketing,inventory management and supply-chain management.

\cvparagraph{Why Me?}
I have worked extensively in web development where I developed and maintained loosely coupled multi-tier applications that required Object Oriented programming. I was responsible for managing the full stack along with the configuration  and implementation on Windows Server microsoft cloud. Since the data was in the most raw form, I had a handful of experience in cleansing, designing the completely denormalized data that was at many different locations into one normalized ACID database and implementing it into production for the Real Estate Tax team at Target. 
I have worked in big data environment where I was required to send close to 200 million records daily from Teradata to Hive using SQOOP embedded SQL queries and then analysing that guest data using python on pySpark.
